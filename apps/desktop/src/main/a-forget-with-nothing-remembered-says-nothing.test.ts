/*
 * A FORGET WITH NOTHING REMEMBERED SAYS NOTHING (0.785).
 *
 * Clean-machine drive, packaged 0.784, 2026-10-17: told its last turn was undone, a teammate on a new computer tried
 * to forget the file it had handed over. Nothing had ever been remembered there, and the thread said in amber "a
 * conversation tried to forget something and could not. ... It is still remembered." -- wrong twice, and the first
 * thing a new person saw after their first Undo. A forget where nothing is remembered has nothing it could mean and
 * nothing for the person to settle, so it says nothing. A forget that misses while memories are there still says so,
 * now opening with a capital.
