/**
 * ONE VOICE CALL AT A TIME, placed by Codex (0.737). See shared/voice-call.ts for what was measured.
 *
 * The window makes the WebRTC offer and plays what comes back; this side starts Codex's app server,
 * checks it is signed in with ChatGPT, opens a read-only thread of its own in the person's folder with
 * every add-on off, asks for the call on realtime v3, and hands the window the voice service's answer.
 * What is said comes back as Codex's transcript notifications and goes to the window as lines.
 *
 * A START IS A CALL FROM ITS FIRST MOMENT (0.738, Sol's review of 0.737, #6 and #11). It was only tracked
 * once Codex had been found and spawned, so two quick presses spawned two servers and stopped one, and an
 * End or a closed window during the start returned before a server was spawned behind it. Now a start holds
 * a ticket from the first line; Stop cancels it at whatever step it has reached, each step looks at it
 * before going on, and an answer that arrives for a call already ended is not handed back as a call.
